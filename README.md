## Introduction

Welcome to the "Trials of the Temple" (Named after the Jedi Training Academy, this whole project will be very Star Wars themed). The prupose of this repository is to teach coding fundamentals using interactive tasks/challenges. 

We will be using C for the purposes of this training. 

Each episode should have a make file, which will help compile the code, and provide a series of tests.

b. You are my only hope </br>
